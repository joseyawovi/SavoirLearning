I‚Äôm happy with the functionality and features you‚Äôve implemented in Savoir+ (student dashboard, admin panel, roadmap, quizzes, trial system, certificates, etc.).

But the design and user interface are poor and do not reflect the quality of the platform.

üéØ I want you to redesign the full frontend using Tailwind CSS and improve the user experience (UX).

üé® Redesign Instructions:
Use a modern, dark-themed UI, like TryHackMe or Hack The Box.

Make the layout fully responsive (mobile + desktop).

Use Tailwind CSS components: cards, grids, navbars, buttons with hover, shadows, spacing.

Focus on clarity and minimalism: don‚Äôt overcrowd the screen.

Replace any generic or unstyled sections with professional component-based layouts.

Pages to Redesign (No Logic Change):
Landing Page (/)

Big hero header: Savoir+ name + subtitle + CTA buttons

Feature highlights: Roadmap-based learning, certificates, mobile payment

Testimonials or quote area

Footer with links, language switcher

Student Dashboard (/dashboard/)

Welcome banner with name and progress summary

Cards for each enrolled room with:

Thumbnail or icon

Progress bar

Button to ‚ÄúContinue‚Äù

Tabs or sections: "Your Rooms", "Certificates", "Roadmap", "Upgrade"

Admin Dashboard (/manage/)

Sidebar with sections: Users, Rooms, Sections, Roadmaps, Payments

Tables styled with Tailwind: search, filter, edit/delete

Modals or popup forms for creating/editing content

Room Page (student view)

Video player at the top

Bilingual lesson text in tabs or toggles

Quiz input field with placeholder style (____)

Submit button with success/fail feedback

Roadmap Page

Visual stepper/grid of rooms

Use icons and color indicators:

Green = completed

Blue = current

Gray = locked

Button to jump into the next section

Notes:
Don‚Äôt change the backend logic or URL routing

Keep CSRF protection and multilingual support working

Reuse existing models and views ‚Äî just improve design and layout

‚úÖ Focus 100% on making it look and feel clean, modern, and intuitive.
I want users to enjoy using it and feel like they‚Äôre on a premium learning platform.
